# VisualVocab

## Project Description  
This project is an interactive web application that allows users to improve their foreign language skills in a playful way. The application displays a 3D room where users are prompted to select specific objects. The goal is to find and click the correct object in the room. The correct selection colors the object green, while an incorrect selection highlights it in red.
